##About
This repository was created following the spark/uber-library-example method to help me learn the specification for what constitutes a valid Particle firmware library.  I will learn this as I go through the project examples in the book 'Make: Getting Started with the Photon', written by Dr. Simon Monk, the author of '15 Dangerously Mad Projects for the Evil Genius' and 'Arduino + Android Projects for the Evil Genius'.
